Project Overview
This project is a Simple Library System designed to manage books and rental operations in a library. It provides an easy-to-use interface for administrators to manage the library's book inventory and for students to borrow and return books.

Core Features
1. Login
Administrator Login: The system includes an authentication mechanism that allows only authorized administrators to log in and manage the library system.
2. Book Management
Add Books: Administrators can add new books to the library's inventory, including details such as title, author, publisher, ISBN, and stock quantity.
Update Books: Administrators can update existing book records, including adjusting stock levels, correcting book details, and more.
Delete Books: Administrators can remove books from the inventory when they are no longer available.
View Books: The system provides a comprehensive view of all books in the library, allowing administrators to easily manage the inventory.
3. Rental Management
Borrow Books: Students can borrow books from the library. The system ensures that the stock is sufficient before processing a rental, and it automatically adjusts the inventory.
Return Books: Students can return books, and the system will update the stock accordingly.
Rental Records: The system tracks all rentals, providing a history of which books were borrowed and by whom.
Problem Solved
This Simple Library System addresses several key challenges faced by libraries:

Inventory Management: The system streamlines the management of book inventories, ensuring that the library always knows the availability of each book.

Efficient Rental Process: The system automates the borrowing and returning process, reducing the manual effort required by library staff and minimizing errors in inventory tracking.

User Access Control: By implementing an administrator login, the system ensures that only authorized personnel can manage the library's book inventory, thus maintaining data integrity and security.

Real-time Updates: The system provides real-time updates on book availability, which helps in preventing over-issuance of books and ensures accurate tracking of borrowed and returned books.
